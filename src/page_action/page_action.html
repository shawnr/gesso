<p>Gesso is running. It will automatically replace your text editor with an enhanced text editor. Although the text editor is enhanced, it is not able to fully replace the features of the built-in text editor. You may toggle between the editors at any time. If you wish to disable this extension entirely, visit <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a> and disable or remove.</p>
